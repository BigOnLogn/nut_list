  Nut List is a feed filter I threw together for the Music Nuts Facebook group.  You may search by date, by user, or both.
</p>
<p>
	Some examples of search:
</p>
<h5>Dates</h5>
<p><code>12/23/12</code> or <code>12/23/2012</code> translates to <code>all posts from 12/23/2012</code></p>

<h5>Real English time frame</h5>
<p><code>2 days ago</code> or <code>yesterday</code> or <code>last week</code> translates to <code>all posts from {given time frame}</code></p>

<h5>Until date</h5>
<p>You can search for all posts until a given date by adding one of the keywords "until", "to", or "up to".
	<code>until 12/23/12</code> or <code>to 12/23/12</code> or <code>up to 12/23/12</code>
	All the above give the same result.
</p>

<h5>Between two dates</h5>
<p>
	You can search for posts made between two dates by using the <code>between/and</code> keywords.
	<code>
		between 1/1/12 and 12/23/12
	</code>
</p>

<h5>By Members</h5>
<p>You can search for posts made by specific members by selecting them from the "by who?" text box. Just start typing and there will be a list of members to choose from</p>

<h5>Combination Search</h5>
<p>Any information entered into either text box will be incorporated into the search, i.e.:
	<code>12/23/12</code> and <code>Kate E Anderson</code> will find all posts made by Kate since 12/23/2012.
